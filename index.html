      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Muhammad was born in Karāchi, (in what is now Pakistan). His father, Jinnahbhai Poonja, was a merchant. Jinnah was homeschooled until 1887 when he went to Sind Madrasat al-Islam in Karachi.

      <p>He went to London to get business experience. When he got there, he joined Lincoln’s Inn, and studied the British political system. Muhammad later helped Dadabhai Naoroji to become the first Indian in the House of Commons. He returned to Karachi in 1896 to do legal practice.
Participated in the session of the INC in 1906 He was elected to Imperial Legislative Council in 1908. He later joined the Muslim League in 1913 after being convinced that they believed in political emancipation of India. Afterward, he tried to get the Congress Party and the Muslim League to work together. Gandhi at the time was in support of non-cooperation with the British. On 1920,  Jinnah left the Home Rule League and the Congress Party because Gandhi took control of these organizations. In 1940, he worked with the Muslim League to create Pakistan which was formed on August 14, 1947. He convinced the Congress Party and the British government to allow it and became the Governor-general until September 11, 1948. He died of tuberculosis.
</p>
    <h2>Major Events</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>His wife and mother died while he was in London.</li>
      <li>He had an unhappy marriage with Rattenbai.</li>
      <li>Got to know Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Maratha.</li>
      <li>The Muslim League was founded in 1906.</li>
      <li>The Lucknow Pact was concluded in 1916.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="section1.3" class="section">
      <h2>Goals/Ideals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Muhammad decided he wanted to be a barrister before being sent to England.</li>
        <li>Was inspired by William E. Gladstone’s liberalism.</li>
        <li>Wanted to be the Gokhale (senior leader of the INC).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Political Affiliations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Was a member of the Muslim League</li>
        <li>Also joined the Home Rule League and the Congress Party, but left after Gandhi took control of the organizations.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="section1.4" class="section">
      <h2>How they'd view the world</h2>
      <p>Jinnah would view the world today negatively and as not peaceful. First, Pakistan’s relationship with India is not friendly. Muhammad wanted Hindu Muslim unity, and because the conflict has not been resolved yet, he would think negatively of it. Second, Pakistan created armed forces to possibly use against India. This would separate the Hindus and Muslims even more. Third, Britain didn’t take further action to make the situation better. He wanted Britain and India to cooperate, but they haven’t worked out a solution together. Jinnah would try to talk to Britain and would try to unite the Indians and Muslims if he lived today.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="section2.1" class="section">
      <h2>Dates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Born in 1787</li>
        <li>Died on September 22, 1828</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="section2.2" class="section">
      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>His father was a chieftain named Senzangakona, and his mother, Nandi, was a princess part of the Langeni clan. The relationship of his parents was against Zulu custom. He was separated from his father and lived with Langeni. Later, Nandi left Langeni and moved with Dletsheni, part of Mthethwa. The chief named Dingiswayo took Shaka to military service for the Mthethwa when he was 23.</p>
      <h2>Adult Life</h2>
      <p>Shaka was sent by Dingiswayo to take over the Zulu. He ruled with an iron fist. When he became the leader, he changed the military. He rearmed the soldiers with assegais with long blades, and he divided them into age groups. He also developed different tactics used by the Zulu. The strongest soldiers were called the chest in the center. The horns were on the sides and attacked the enemy from behind. The loins were in the back to fill in for any part that was failing. Shaka took over multiple clans and increased the military by a factor of four. He destroyed clans to the south of the Zulu dispersing the survivors. Shaka started the Mfecane in the 1820s crushing the inland plateau leaving almost only the Zulu. The Boer's survived in the 1830s because no one was there to threaten them. When Nandi died in 1827, Shaka killed 7000 Zulus and no crops or milk was consumed. Pregnant women, their husbands, and thousands of milch cows were killed. His half-brothers,  Dingane and Mhlangana, and Mbopa killed him in September. His body was thrown into a pit, and no one knows where it is.
      </p>
      <h2>Major Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In 1816, Senzangakona died.</li>
        <li>In 1817, Dingiswayo was killed.</li>
        <li>In 1824, Europeans showed up in Port Natal to open a trading port and were allowed to stay.</li>
        <li>In 1827, Nandi died.</li>

    <div id="section2.3" class="section">
      <h2>Goals/Ideals/Political Affiliations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased the strength of the Zulu army.</li>
        <li>Wanted to conquer everything.</li>
        <li>He was a tyrant.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="section2.4" class="section">
      <h2>How they'd view the world</h2>
      <p>Shaka Zulu would view the world as disappointing. First, the Zulu lost to Britain and became a colony. He would be disappointed that the Zulu didn’t win the war. Second, the Zulu Land does not exist today and is divided into other countries. Shaka would have wanted to be in power, and would be disappointed that there is no kingdom. Third, his mother is still dead. When this occurred he became mentally unstable which probably would make him disappointed that she wasn’t there. If Shaka was still alive he would want to take over multiple countries in Africa and become the king of a new empire.</p>

      <h2>Dates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Born on December 26, 1893</li>

    <div id="section3.2" class="section">
      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Mao was born in Shaoshan part of a peasant family. His family was better off than other people who were poor. He began doing hard work at his family’s farm when he was 13, and when he was 14, a marriage was planned. He left his family’s farm when he was 16 for education and didn’t marry. He went to Changsha. In 1911, he joined the Revolutionary Army and the Kuomintang.</p>
      <h2>Adult Life</h2>
      <p>He graduated from Hunan First Normal School in 1918 and went on to become a librarian assistant at Beijing University. In 1921, he joined the Communist party after hearing the success of the Soviet Union. When Sun Yat-sen took power against communists, Mao led an army against him which were easily defeated. They retreated to Jiang Xi province where he led the Soviet Republic of China to kill anyone who went against the Communists. At this time 10 regions were controlled by the Communists. In October 1934, Chiang ordered 1 million government forces to attack the area. Mao convinced the communists to flee and started the long march across the mountains where 30,000 survived out of 100,000. He became the top Communist leader and helped as a military leader to fight against Japan in July 1937. On October 1, 1949, Mao announced a new country called The People's Republic of China and caused Chiang Kai-shek to go to Taiwan to create the Republic of China. He set out reforms to increase the status of women, healthcare, and school population. In 1956, he allowed people to have a say in how the government works, but later put people in prison for going extremely against him. On January 1958, he set forward The Great Leep Foward which put people to work for agriculture and industrial production. It failed and caused 40 million people to die from famine. One of Mao’s followers, Lin Biao, took some things that Mao said and put it in a book called “Little Red Book”. In 1966, he came back to become a leader and started the Cultural Revolution which the youth wouldn’t remember. He said that capitalism must be removed from society and created the Red Guard who purged the people who supported it. He closed down schools and forced people to be re-educated by going to labor camps. This led to economic instability and the removal of traditional China. He died from Parkinsons Disease.

      <h2>Major Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sun Yat-sen died in March 1925 and was replaced by Chiang Kai-shek.</li>
        <li>In April 1927, Sun Yat-sen started a war against the Communists killing many.</li>
        <li>In July 1937, the Japanese invaded China</li>

        <li>Believed in Karl Marx’s ideas</li>

    <div id="section3.4" class="section">
      <h2>How they'd view the world today</h2>
      <p>Mao would view the world as failing and anti-communist. First, the government and Deng Xiaoping pushed toward capitalism. Since Mao was part of the Communist party, this would make him think that China is failing. Next, many people today are very rich in China. This goes against equality in China and also is evidence against China being a Communist country. Last, the Soviet Union doesn’t exist anymore. Mao befriended and was inspired by the Soviet Union using Communism and would probably be unhappy that they do not exist. If Mao were alive today, he would try to get China to move to a Communist system.</p>
